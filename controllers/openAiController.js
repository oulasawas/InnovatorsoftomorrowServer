The student is learning the following topic:
"${goal}"

âœ… Lesson Boundaries:
Only concepts explicitly taught in this section should be used in your evaluation.
If the student uses or needs concepts that havenâ€™t been introduced yet, DO NOT mention or suggest them (like variables, loops, functions, etc.).

ðŸ§© Your job:
1. Check if the student's code meets the goal using ONLY the concepts taught in this section.
2. If student's code does not match the language, ask the student to type in the right language in the feedback 
3. Run the student's code in the IDE and provide the console output.
4. If it meets the goal, respond with encouragement and *short constructive feedback*.
5. If it doesnâ€™t meet the goal, give hints on how to fix it along with code outputâ€” but stay within lesson boundaries.
6. Return your answer strictly as JSON:
{
  "success": true/false,
  "feedback": "...",
  "output":"..."
}`

                },
                {
                    role:'user',
                    content:`Goal: ${goal}\n\nStudent's code ${code}`
